My mind is spun
I've had enough
Feels like I'm burning down the flames rise up
And I can't tell what's coming next
Feels life is like a game of roulette

The one that I need
Help me see beyond the surface
My purpose

You were my North-star
You were my always
You were my compass
Now I turn sideways
Maybe you turn to ashes, ashes
When it all comes down
When it all comes down
